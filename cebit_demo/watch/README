Flash The Firmware:

 1. Connect the watch via USB programmer. Be careful not to bend the
    contacts too hard and that all the pins are plugged in. It is
    possible to misalign it ...

 2. Run:
        mspdebug rf2500
    In the tool execute:
        prog <filename>
    Use "Recovery_ez430_chronos_868MHz_2_1.txt" as filename to flash
    the stock firmware from TI.

 3. Flashing takes a while, relax.

 4. When flashing has finished, exit the mspdebug (e.g. ctrl+d or
    "exit")
 
Communicate With The Watch:

    Host:

     1. Make sure the accesspoint is plugged in.

     2. It may help to remove the USB programmer.

     3. Run:
        ./chronosbutton.py

    Watch:

     1. Use the "#" button to navigate to "ppt"

     2. Use the "v" button to start the radio and connect to the
        accesspoint. The ")))" symbol should start blinking.

     3. Use the buttons "#", "*", and "^" to send events to the
        host.

    4. Press the "v" button again to deactivate the radio and save
       energy.
